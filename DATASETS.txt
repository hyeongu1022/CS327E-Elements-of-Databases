Interesting entities and attributes you noticed in the data:
Our group found interesting that there are two separate variables for approvals and denials of H-1B VISA: Initial Approvals/Denials and Continuing Approvals/Denials. We thought this is very reasonable fact because H-1B VISA can be tried multiple of times.


3-5 lines of sample data for each entity of interest:
H-1B dataset:

explain what insights you hope to gain from exploring the data:
We are international students who will eventually confront any VISA problem if we seek for any jobs in US. We would like to analyze these datasets and hope to gain knowledge about which areas of occupation, or occupation itself, have requested for many H-1B. We would like to see which ownership (private or local government, etc..) of occupation tends to request for H-1B petition more. In addition, we hope to derive insight about the income difference between those areas/occupations that companies tend to request for H-1B and those that are not. In the end, we would like to derive informative insight that may be helpful to international students like ourselves.
